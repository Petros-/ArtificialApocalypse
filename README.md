# Artificial Apocalypse

## Background

I wanted to make an app that would stretch my skills, and this definitely did that. The easy part (for me) was making the robots and other artwork, and I thought I'd be able to spend most of my time on the game mechanic and logic, but it turned out that controlling the pause/resume of the game was pretty hard, so I spent a lot of time on that.
