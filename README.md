# Artificial Apocalypse
Because the word definitely needs another space invaders game.

## Synopsis
Move your protagonist left and right with the arrow keys and use the space bar to fire projectiles that will prevent the oncoming robots from stealing your job. There's a fun sound if you win. 

## Artwork
The characters are original creations of my own. Please don't copy or use somewhere else! :)
